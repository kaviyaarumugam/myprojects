        <h3>Are there any preservatives in your products?</h3><br></br><br></br>
        <p>No, there are no additives or preservatives in any Mann™ products, 
            including the many products we offer that are cut, pre-washed and ready to use.</p>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <h3>What is used to wash the vegetables?</h3><br></br><br></br>
            <p>Our vegetables are processed through a wash water system that is monitored to ensure it meets all national drinking water standards.
                 We use a combination of chlorine and citric acid to balance the pH of the water and to ensure the cleanest product possible.</p><br></br><br></br>
            <h3>Do you use pesticides or are the veggies organic?</h3><br></br><br></br>
            <p>We offer both “conventional” (non organic) and organic products. Our veggies are monitored through the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) integrated pest 
                management system, and both our conventionally and organic grown vegetables meet or exceed all of the standards and requirements.</p><br></br><br></br>
